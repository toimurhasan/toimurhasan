I‚Äôm currently an English Literature student who found clarity in code. While literature sharpened my communication, empathy, and narrative thinking, I realized I also have the *personality of a system builder* ‚Äî introverted, reflective, and wired for structured, strategic thinking. That led me to dive deep into the world of full-stack web development, especially the MERN stack.

üß† As an INTJ, I love designing systems from scratch, iterating over and over until every piece aligns with the bigger picture. My work blends technical precision with conceptual clarity ‚Äî whether I‚Äôm building a collaborative study platform like **PeerSolve** or a community-based hobby app like **HobbyHub**.

üî≠ I‚Äôm currently focused on mastering **React** and evolving as a full-stack engineer, with the long-term goal of working at a **big tech company** where I can lead small, focused teams solving meaningful problems.

‚úçÔ∏è Just as Shakespeare crafted words that echo across centuries, I want to write code with the same intention ‚Äî durable, thoughtful, and impactful. To me, *a system is a story*, and every great developer is a bit of a poet.

üì´ Reach out if you want to talk about React architecture, the hero‚Äôs journey in career-building, or how metaphor lives in both poetry and product design.

üëë Fun Fact: I believe a great function and a great sonnet share the same thing ‚Äî elegant logic wrapped in beautiful form.
